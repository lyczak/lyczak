### hi, i'm Del.
i use [they/she](https://en.pronouns.page/they/them/themself&she) pronouns. my primary interests lie at the intersection of computers, music, and gender. this includes digital audio processing and synthesis (specifically vocal resynthesis) and general reverse-engineering as well as many other things. i am a graduate of Lafayette College and i've also [done research](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~dl1032/) at Rutgers University. if you have questions that aren't answered here, feel free to check [my website](https://del.lyczak.net) or email me at `dlyczak (at) protonmail (dot) com`.

*I prefer to use [my Gitea instance](https://git.lyczak.net) over GitHub, who [collaborates with ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice).*
