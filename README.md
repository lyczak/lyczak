### Hi, I'm Del.
My pronouns are they/them/theirs. I'm currently a student at Lafayette College majoring in Electrical and Computer Enginering and minoring in Women's, Gender, and Sexuality Studies. I'm interested in web application reverse-engineering, digital audio processing and synthesis, and systems administration (among other things).  If you have questions that aren't answered here, feel free to check [my website](https://www.lyczak.net) or email me at `dlyczak (at) protonmail (dot) com`.

*I prefer to use [my Gitea instance](https://git.lyczak.net) over GitHub, who [collaborates with ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice).*
