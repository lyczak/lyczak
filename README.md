### hi, i'm Del.
my primary interests lie at the intersection of computers and art. this includes digital signal processing and synthesis as well as general reverse-engineering and many other things. i am a graduate of Lafayette College and i've also [done research](https://reu.dimacs.rutgers.edu/~dl1032/) at Rutgers University. if you have questions that aren't answered here, feel free to check [my website](https://del.lyczak.net) or reach out to me via email.

*[i do not support GitHub](https://giveupgithub.org/) and only use it out of necessity. you can find me on [my Gitea instance](https://git.lyczak.net).*

any use of my code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission. i do not consent to GitHub's use of any code tied to my account in Copilot.
