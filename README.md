### Hi, I'm Del.
[My pronouns](https://delta.lyczak.net/pronouns.md) are they/she. I'm currently a student at Lafayette College, studying [CS](https://compsci.lafayette.edu/) and [WGSS](https://wgs.lafayette.edu/). I'm interested in web application reverse-engineering, digital audio processing and synthesis, and systems administration (among other things).  If you have questions that aren't answered here, feel free to check [my website](https://delta.lyczak.net) or email me at `dlyczak (at) protonmail (dot) com`.

*I prefer to use [my Gitea instance](https://git.lyczak.net) over GitHub, who [collaborates with ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice).*
